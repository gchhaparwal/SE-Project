Scalable Tag Recommendation System

**About Project**
Nowadays, software engineers utilise a range of internet media to seek for and learn about new and fascinating technologies, as well as to learn from and assist one another. Software information sites are online media that assist software engineers in improving their performance in software development, maintenance, and testing procedures. Tags are
prevalent on software information websites, and many websites enable users to tag various items with their own phrases. Tags are increasingly being used by users to indicate the
most essential aspects of their submitted material or projects. Unfortunately, tagging is fundamentally an ad hoc procedure. Individual software engineers tag selection is influenced not just by their grasp of the programme object, but also by their English skills and preferences. As a result, the number of distinct tags is quickly increasing in line with the continual addition of software items. Software objects become poorly identified when hundreds of distinct tags are used, many of which create noise. This issue has a detrimental impact on the speed and accuracy of developer inquiries. We propose a system to increase the quality of tags on software information sites. This system finds software objects that are semantically related to the new one and makes use of their tags. In this project we experimented our system on Stackoverflow dataset and performed experiments on small dataset, large dataset, by restricting top 50 tags and by performing experiments on tags which have more threshold value and resulted with 66.5%, 87.57%, 64% and 43.03% of the best accuracy respectively using the best suitable models.
